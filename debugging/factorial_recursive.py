    This function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

    n (int): The number for which the factorial is calculated. The function 
             works by recursively multiplying n with the factorial of n-1.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of the number n. If n is 0, it returns 1 as the base case.
